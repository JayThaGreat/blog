<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did I persue software development??</h3>

<p> Learning to code has been a passion I've wanted to take on for quite some time now. In a perfect world, I would say that any beginner developer stumbles accross programming when a project requires some automation at least. Now perhaps that's not entirely true, but I think that if I had a need to build out some scripts I would've caught on rather sooner.</p>

<p> I took up coding while in college. The program requirements included a few Java courses, which were fantastic. One of my most challenging projects in the class was building out the functionality of a car's odometer. It was pretty cool because it calculated the miles per gallon relative to the distance traveled in addition to its speed. This course opened my eyes to open source software and the desire to contribute so that I can gain some experience. However, my main focus was information security and therefore I did not continue developing as much on my own time. Instead I learned how to use a load of security tools and protocols. Yet my path still led me to development.</p>

<p> My pursuit of learning to hack and finding hacks stemmed from sites like 'www.EnigmaGroup.org'. This site (which is still up and running) contains several labs which teach you how to exploit vulnerabilities in webapps amongst other things. These exploits were based off OWASP's top webapp vulnerabilities which helped me learn the basics of SQL, XSS, HTML, and JavaScript because the labs were composed of code written in these languages.</p>

<p> After graduating I continued my primary passion in information security and began my career consulting for NYC's largest transportation agency, the MTA. As I gained experience, I realized that I wanted to expand my horizons to embody software development. I have a nack for problem solving and I love finding solutions to tricky obstacles. Luckily, a friend of mine mentioned that he wanted to join a program at the FlatIron school for software development. They have a web development program that teaches the full stack using ruby as the primary language, and I decided to give it a shot. So far I've had a blast learning to code with the program. </p>
