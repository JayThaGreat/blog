<p> Learning to code has been a passion I've wanted to take on ever since my college days. In college I took some Java intro courses, and although it was challenging, I found it pretty fun. In college I took some Java intro courses, and although it was challenging, I found it pretty fun.

<p>One of my projects required building out the functionality of an odometer. It was pretty cool to actually see the finished product in action. Projects like these and the professor for this course, opened my eyes to open source software and how to contribute so that I can also gain some experience. However, at the time, my main focus was for my career in information security. Therefore I took up software development as a hobby. I spent most of my time learning about networking protocols, as well as security and web applications.</p>

<p> My pursuit of learning to hack stemmed from sites like 'www.EnigmaGroup.org'. This site (which is still up and running) contains several labs which teach you how to exploit vulnerabilities in webapps. These exploits were based off OWASP's top webapp vulnerabilities which helped me learn the basics of SQL, XSS, HTML, and JavaScript because the labs were composed of code written in these languages.</p>

<p> After graduating I began my career by consulting for NYC's largest transportation agency, the MTA. The experience there helped me establish a strong understanding of network and security, as well as the realization that I enjoyed problem solving as much as finding clever solutions. Luckily, a friend of mine mentioned that he wanted to join a program at the FlatIron school for software development. They have a web development program that teaches the full stack using ruby as the primary language, and I decided it was a great learning opportunity so I gave it a shot. So far I've had a blast learning to code with the program. Now I have learned about several different languages, and have a couple others that I want to take on.</p>

<p>Learn. Love. Code.</p>
