	<p>Mitre's Att&ck Patterns is an application used to display the data provided by the original source at <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/enterprise-introduction/">mitre's website</a>. Att&ck, originally from Mitre, stands for (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge), and with the data provided to their Enterprise network this application provides a friendly user-interface for navigation. The data from the Enterprise network is used as a knowledge base of cyber threat intelligence with attacks and techniques that adversaries use to exploit vulnerabilities found in software, and computer hardware. </p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Prior to building out this application, I made a list of the requirements and dependencies, as well as any steps for the app's design. I chose to build the app based on the React, Redux, and Rails frameworks mainly because they are the ones I'm most familiar with.</p>
	<br></br>

	<p>I built out the front-end part of the application first and left the back-end portion using rails for last. To start off, I used a simple command <q>create-react-app</q> that basically builds out a bare-bones react application. With this as my starting point, I began building out the components, reducers, and an actions file in order to include functions to dispatch defined actions asynchronously. During this process I defined my react store first. I made sure to include imports for the dependencies that would allow me to create the store, and also use thunk middleware for asynchronous promises as well as redux devtools extension which is useful for redux debugging. 
	<br></br>
I built out a Navbar component for the app's navigation, and decided to use react-bootstrap for the app's interface. Once I had that layed out, I went ahead and built out the presentation components AttacksShow for individual patterns, an AttacksList for all attack patterns, an About, a datasource filter component and a platform filter component. To manage the attack patterns, I built out an AttackPatterns container component, and to separate responsibilities I built a component to manage the filters. 
<br></br>
The lifecycle for the application begins with the routing at the App component which was generated by the create-react-app command. The routing at the App component routes all the links in the Navbar, and loads the AttackPatternsContainer when <q>/attacks</q> is visited. Once this component is loaded and is mounted, the "fetchAttackPatterns" function is called from the actions file. This function dipatches is what queries the API and dispatches an action that loads all the patterns using the AttacksReducer after receiving the query's response. This same function also dispatches an action to the FilterReducer which sets the filters based on the datasources and platforms from the query's response.
<br></br>
In order to manage the attackPatterns loaded from the store's state, I made sure to store them in the AttackPatternContainer's local state. With this in place I'd be able to store filtered patterns in a separate array besides the attackPatterns array also within the container's local state. To establish filtering functionality, I built out the "handleFilterAttackPatterns" function in order to pass it as props to the FilterContainer. With this in place I'd be able to filter based on selections from filter components within the FilterContainer. Within this container, and apart from the FilterContainer, and AttacksList component, I included the switch component for the react router to be able to route and display individual attack patterns. With React Router's match object, I can pass the attackPattern's id to the attacksShow component which will render the correct pattern. The AttacksList component is responsible for listing the filteredPatterns passed to it as props from the AttackPatternsContainer.
<br></br>
With the React front end built out, I generated the Rails API back-end server. After that, I added some gem dependencies like rack-cors in order to allow calls to the server, and the pry gem for debugging.  Using the "rails new <app-name> --api" command, I had a bare-bones rails API application. I then chose which properties I wanted to keep from an AttackPattern in order to generate the models and build out the seeds file and populate the database using a local copy of the Enterprise dataset found via Mitre's API. Once the seeding was finalized, the application was all done-did-oh!
