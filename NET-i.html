My first sinatra application was a simple blog app. I found it somewhat challenging, but thought that I could revisit the project after learning some rails. After learning some rails I came up with some better ideas of what to build and decided to create a new application. I also figured it would be pretty cool to use bootstrap so that I would have a template to work off of. Besides Bootstrap helped me come up with the idea in the first place.

First thing I did was take some notes of what I would need, so I wrote down a list of tasks to be completed. On that list I had database, models, associations, controllers, actions, views and forms.
I then added little bullet points for each of these specifying what they would need. This helped me build out the application rather well as I tackled each task one by one. I also looked at some old sinatra labs, and other students' sinatra projects online, which led me to actually try and implement the dashboard template from bootstrap and what my initial sinatra environment set up would be. So I also added this to my to-do list because using the bootstrap template would give me cool looking navbar layouts amongst everything else.

I wanted there to be user access to the application so I looked for a ways to add roles to users for sinatra. After some research, I found several gems I could use and Warden was one of them. However, I had a difficult time figuring out how to implement Warden so I was lucky enough to find "authlane" but in the end I decided not to use any of these and just implement a users and sessions controller to handle authentication. This worked perfectly, a little extra code but that's fine. I also got to learn a bit about how those other gems worked.

While building out the application I started noticing that I was deviating from objective. I wanted to add more and more functionality and I guess this is the thought process of any programmer, but I decided to stick with the initial plan and successfully built what I had in mind.
